# Final project

**Explain the general theme and specific features of your project.**
I am trying to prove the problem of Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg. There are 4 landmasses with 7 bridges. The question is whether it is possible to travel all bridges exactly once.
I use the Euler's analysis to prove that it is impossible to travel all bridges exactly once. It would require the prove of a graph being connected, with more than nodes with odd number of vertices.


**Cite any resources or existing code you used.**
I use Builtin Agda library and project 1 and 2 codes such as Vector, Fin.


**Discuss any challenges, or anything you'd like feedback on.**
I think the most difficult part of my project is setting up the Dependent Type to prove the theorem. After that, creating these independent types is less difficult, even though there are some extremes in my opinion.
